                <p>The tournaments will be completely optional, informal and with no pressure to join.</p><p>We want this society to be as inclusive to as many skill levels as possible and whilst competing can be a great way to improve skill, they are often far too competitive for a social society. However, we will be running small tournaments outside of our normal weekly sessions for anybody who wishes to take part.</p>
